      <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>250ml water</li>
        <li>2tsp salt</li>
        <li>300g flour (or as much as it takes to make dough)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>250g minced meat</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Garnish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sour cream (or mayonnaise if your name is Boris)</li>
        <li>Dill or green onion</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Dough:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add one egg and 250ml water. Whisk the 
          ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add salt. Continue whisking.</li>
        <li>Add some flour and continue to whisk. Keep adding flour until the 
          ingredients become dough.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough. On a floured surface, knead the dough for a 
          minute.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a bowl or plastic wrap and let it sit for 
          20-30 minutes.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Finely chop or blend the onion and garlic. Make the pieces as small
          as possible!</li>
        <li>Add minced meat, onion and garlic to a bowl and knead together
          with a spoon or your hands.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Making pelmeni:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take your dough and roll it out as thinly as possible. It's best to
          flour your rolling pin and surface.</li>
        <li>For pelmeni skins, cut out palm-sized circles in the dough using a 
          cup or something similar.</li>
        <li>Take a circle and put enough meat so that there is enough space
          around the edge of the circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the pelmeni skin in half and pinch the edge together. 
          (Or close it however you like.)</li>
        <li>Repeat from step one to finish making all pelmeni.</li>
        <li>Fill a well-sized pot halfway with water and add salt. Set it to 
          boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is at a boil, insert the pelmeni into the water with 
          a slotted spoon/ladle.</li>
        <li>Boil for 7 minutes, shuffling the pelmeni around occasionally.</li>
        <li>After boiling, scoop out the pelmeni with the slotted spoon/ladle 
          and put them on a plate.</li>
        <li>Dress the pelmeni with a generous amount of sour cream or mayonnaise
          on top, and garnish with a sprinkle of dill or green onion.</li>
      </ol>
