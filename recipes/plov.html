  <h2>Description</h2>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>300g meat (whatever you like)</li>
    <li>300g rice</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>1 whole garlic</li>
    <li>3 carrots</li>
    <li>Sunflower seed oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Parsley (for serving)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the meat into chunks of your preferred size.</li>
    <li>Add a thin layer of oil to a medium size pot.</li>
    <li>Put the pot on the oven and set it to boil.</li>
    <li>When the oil is hot, add the meat chunks to oil.</li>
    <li>While the pot is boiling, cut up the onion into big pieces. 
      Add the onion to the pot and mix the contents around gently.</li>
    <li>Cut up the carrots into quarter logs (so they survive cooking).
      Add them to the pot and mix.</li>
    <li>Peel the bulb of garlic. You don't need to break it apart.</li>
    <li>Wash the rice, if you'd like.</li>
    <li>Add your preferred amount of salt to the pot.</li>
    <li>Add water to the pot until the ingredients start floating.</li>
    <li>Put the bulb of garlic in the middle of the pot.</li>
    <li>Let it boil for around 10 minutes, until the water level returns 
      to what it was before.</li>
    <li>Remove the garlic bulb from the pot and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Carefully add rice to the top to create a surface of rice. 
      No more mixing after this point!</li>
    <li>Set the stove to low heat. 
      Spread out the rice evenly in the pot. 
      (Try not to mix the layers of ingredients together.)</li>
    <li>Add water until there is about 2cm of water above rice.
      (Try not to mix the layers of ingredients together.)</li>
    <li>Let the pot sit until the water evaporates. 
      (You can mix the rice while waiting, but don't go too deep.)</li>
    <li> When water is gone, push the garlic bulb deep into the middle of the 
      rice. Cover it with a bit of rice.</li>
    <li>Poke 3 holes in the rice with a stick.</li>
    <li>Cover pot partially with small gap. 
      Cover the pot with a towel before using the lid, if you'd like.</li>
    <li>Let sit for 5 min.</li>
    <li>Open the pot and stir the rice around. 
      (Remember not to mix the top and bottom layers.)
      Add water if needed.</li>
    <li>Poke holes in the rice and cover the pot again. 
      This time let it sit for 20 min.</li>
    <li>You're done! Finally, you can mix everything together. 
      Serve in a bowl with a leaf of parsley on top.</li>
  </ol>
